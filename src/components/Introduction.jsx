I completed my 10th and 12th grades with the Bihar Board, Patna. Recently, I did an internship in web development, focusing on frontend technologies, which improved my skills in creating user-friendly interfaces and engaging web experiences.

                    My skills include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Tailwind CSS, PHP, and Bootstrap. I've worked on several projects, including a Placement Management System that efficiently manages student placements, a React Portfolio showcasing my skills and projects, and a Todo List app with features like adding, deleting, and editing tasks using Bootstrap for styling and routing for navigation.

                    Apart from coding, I enjoy dancing, playing volleyball, and taking walks in nature, which often inspire me. These activities help me stay creative and energetic.

                    In the short term, I want to become a frontend developer, focusing on design and user experience. My long-term goal is to become a versatile software developer, contributing to innovative tech projects. I believe in continuous learning, adaptability, and striving for excellence. I am eager to connect with like-minded individuals and explore the exciting world of technology together! </p>
